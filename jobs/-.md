We need a graphic designer with UI/UX in mind and basic experience with frontend development. Means should be familiar with HTML/CSS/Javascript at least.
Being a project about cryptocurrencies a general understanding of that is also appreciated.
What is mandatory is the use of GIT and having already experience with working in open source projects.
